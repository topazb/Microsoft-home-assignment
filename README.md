# DevOps Engineer Technical Assignment

This repository holds my work for the DevOps Engineer assignment. I used Terraform to automate infrastructure setup on AWS and added YAML configuration files for deployment with CloudFormation. There’s also an optional bonus task with Kubernetes configurations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into three main directories, each representing a specific task in the assignment:

- **Task_1** - Main infrastructure provisioning using Terraform ans AWS.
- **Task_2** - Deployment configuration using CloudFormation YAML files.
- **Task_3(Bonus)** - Kubernetes configuration for container orchestration.

Each directory contains a dedicated `README.md` file with detailed instructions and explanations for that task.

## Getting Started

To set up and deploy the infrastructure, please follow the instructions provided in each task's README file. Start with **Task 1** for initial infrastructure setup, followed by **Task 2** for deployment configuration, and proceed to **Task 3** for the Kubernetes bonus task.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed to execute the configurations:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (for the Kubernetes bonus task)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (for authentication and configuration)

## How to Run

Instructions for setting up and deploying each component can be found within the individual task directories.

Please refer to each task's `README.md` for detailed setup steps, requirements, and deployment instructions.
